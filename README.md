## üîç Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition and performance using SQL, based on the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into why employees leave the organization, identify key factors influencing attrition, and evaluate employee performance metrics. The dataset includes various attributes such as employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, work-life balance, and more.

By leveraging SQL queries, this project explores trends, patterns, and correlations within the data to help organizations make data-driven decisions to reduce attrition and improve employee retention.

## Analysis Goals
1). Employee Attrition Analysis: Identify the percentage of employees who left the company and explore the reasons behind their departure.

2). Performance Metrics: Evaluate employee performance ratings and their relationship with factors like job role, department, and satisfaction levels.

3). Demographic Insights: Analyze how age, gender, and marital status impact attrition and performance.

4). Department and Job Role Analysis: Compare attrition rates and performance across different departments and job roles.

5). Work Environment Factors: Investigate the impact of work-life balance, overtime, and job involvement on employee retention.

## üéØ Key Objectives
1). SQL Queries: Comprehensive SQL scripts for data exploration, cleaning, and analysis.

2). Insights and Visualizations: Key findings and trends derived from the dataset (visualizations can be added using tools like Tableau or Power BI).

3). Dataset: The IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset is included for reference.

4). Documentation: Detailed explanations of the SQL queries and their purpose.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
1). Clone the repository or download the SQL scripts.

2). Load the dataset into your preferred SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

3). Execute the SQL queries to perform the analysis.

4). Use the insights to create reports or visualizations for stakeholders.
