## Description

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition and performance using SQL, based on the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into why employees leave the organization, identify key factors influencing attrition, and evaluate employee performance metrics. The dataset includes various attributes such as employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, work-life balance, and more.

By leveraging SQL queries, this project explores trends, patterns, and correlations within the data to help organizations make data-driven decisions to reduce attrition and improve employee retention.
